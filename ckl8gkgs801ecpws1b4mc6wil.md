## Resources for learning Haskell

*I'll be updating this page through out 2022* 

Haskell is a functional programming language that originated in the 1990s. Like most functional programming languages, Haskell has a reputation for being particularly challenging to learn for newcomers to this paradigm. Over the decades, it has built a legendary cult status amongst programmers. Here are some resources to help you conquer this language.

 [Functional Programming in Haskell: Supercharge Your Coding](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell)  - online course at FutureLearn.

Free to undertake, the FeatureLearn functional programming course is divided up into six weeks of two hours study per week. Created by the University of Glasgow - widely considered the home of Haskell - this course is equal part code exercises and part video tutorials. By the end of the course, there is an assumed knowledge of advanced mathematics that some will find intimidating.

[The Haskell Phrasebook](https://typeclasses.com/phrasebook) website is a "is a free quick-start Haskell guide comprised of a sequence of small annotated programs."

[*Haskell Programming From First Principles*](https://haskellbook.com/) by [Christoph Allen](https://bitemyapp.com/) and [Julie Moronuki](https://argumatronic.com/).

At nearly 2k pages, this is currently the main book which Haskell neophytes learn from. Groups form their own study circles, such as organised by the [Berlin Functional Programming Group](https://twitter.com/berlinfpgroup?lang=en), and readers use the IRC channels #haskell and #haskell-beginners

As well as being the author of *Programming in Haskell*, Graham Hutton is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. He leads the undergraduate Haskell module. During the pandemic, the university switched to online learning and [Graham uploaded his pre-recorded tutorials to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIprO6zoujM).
